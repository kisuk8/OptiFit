##  Overview

**OptiFit** is a modern Android fitness and nutrition application designed to **increase user motivation, engagement, and consistency** through:

- Adaptive visualizations
- Personalized feedback
- Gamification
- AI-driven assistance

Many existing fitness applications rely on static interfaces and repetitive workout plans, which often fail to sustain long-term engagement. OptiFit addresses this issue by combining **real-time feedback, AI interaction, and cloud-based personalization**.

##  Research Objective

This project explores the following research question:

> **Do adaptive visualizations and personalized feedback increase user motivation and consistency compared to static, non-adaptive fitness interfaces?**

### Hypothesis
Users who receive:
- Dynamically adjusted goals  
- Real-time performance feedback  
- Evolving progress visualizations  
- Gamification elements  
- Personalized AI guidance  

will demonstrate **higher engagement, perceived motivation, consistency, and well-being** compared to users of static, one-size-fits-all fitness applications.
